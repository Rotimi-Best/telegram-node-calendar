# telegram-node-calendar
A telegram inline calendar in Nodejs..

Built on [telegram-node-bot](https://github.com/Naltox/telegram-node-bot)

I made this because I just needed a calendar interface for a [todo bot](https://github.com/Rotimi-Best/mytodos) I am working on and I was inspired by this exact same [one written in Python](https://github.com/unmonoqueteclea/calendar-telegram).

# Usage
- You need to create a `.env` file and add an API_KEY=<KEY_FROM_BOT_FATHER>
- Then run `npm install` and `node index.js`
- Go to telegram and use the /calendar command

# Contribution
As you saw from the demo, I wasn't able to create the next and previous button for the inline button after the first click, if anyone knows how to get that done, please make a pull request and make it. Thank you.
